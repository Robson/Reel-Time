# Contributing Films

Film recommendations are very welcome.

## Requirements
 * The film title must contain an amount of time.
 * The film must be released.
 * The film must have at least 1,000 votes on the IMDb.
 * The film title must be displayed in English on the IMDb film poster.
 * The film poster+title must be suitable for viewing in a work environment.

## Order of Preference
If there are multiple films with the same amount of time, I include the best one using this order of preference:

### Best
The best film titles clearly refer to the entire unit of time:
 * Thirteen Minutes
 * Rush Hour
 * Around the World in 80 Days
 * 12 Years a Slave

### Okay
Some film titles are not as good, but still worthy of including:
 * Ten Seconds to Hell (_this could be considered as a point in time, rather than an amount of time_)
 * 28 Days Later (_this could be considered as a point in time, rather than an amount of time_)

### No
Some films titles don't work in our context, even if they initially seem as though they would:
 * 9/11: Minute by Minute (_this has units of time, but no clear amount of time_)
 * Trouble Every Day (_ambiguous_)
 * In Our Day (_has a unit of time, but it's not really referring to that amount of time_)

## Notes
Here are the conversions that I use for some ambiguous amounts of time:
 * Morning = 6 Hours
 * Afternoon = 6 Hours
 * Evening = 6 Hours
 * Night = 12 Hours (_because this is generally used in the context of day and night_)
 * February = 28 Days
 * Month = 30 Days 
 * Summer = 93.6 days in the Northern Hemisphere and 89.0 days in the Southern Hemisphere

If a film title contains the word _Day_ I try to determine if that is referring to an entire day (24 Hours) or just the non-night part of a day (12 hours). For example, the film _Six Days, Seven Nights_ would be the 12-hour version, whilst the film _400 Days_ would be the 24-hour version.
